Introduction:
This Website shows everything we have learned and putting everything into a functionable website, I purposely decided to tackle a Live Messaging App and gather information on how to put it all together, reminder, we were not taught about messaging app, i had to do alot of research
Thanks to Arthur Bernier i managed to get my project going.
Props.Arthur for helping. 
First learned about Socket.io by youtube, and made me go into the documentation 
https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-api/
just reading documentation was a callenged, alot of ways to use and make the messaging App and alot of information




Technology Used:
REACT,
BootStrap,
Node,
MongooseDB,
Express,
Socket.io,
JSON



how it works:
home screeen click on top left hand corner and select sign up or login option, will re route you to login screen or sign up screen
then you will locate a round button, select what you want to do , sign up or login to alternate the forms. once you do that, you will be re routed to the next screen to add messages


Challenges:
reading more documentation and getting Socket io to work, will keep on reading
